# Cross Domain NER (Named Entity Recognition)

## Introduction

This repository contains code for Cross Domain Named Entity Recognition (NER), a task in natural language processing (NLP) that involves identifying and classifying entities (such as names of persons, organizations, locations, etc.) in text data across different domains.

## Files

- `basic_vectorizations_experiment.py`: Python script for conducting experiments using basic vectorization techniques.
- `conditional_random_fields_model.py`: Python script implementing a Conditional Random Fields (CRF) model for NER.
- `linguistical_classifier.py`: Python script for implementing a classifier based on linguistic features for NER.
- `linguistical_features_extractor.py`: Python script for extracting linguistic features from text data.
- `most_frequent_entities_data_analysis.py`: Python script for analyzing the most frequent entities in the data.
- `spacy_experiment.py`: Python script for experimenting with NER using spaCy library.
- `train_fasttext.py`: Python script for training word embeddings using FastText.
- `train_word2vec.py`: Python script for training word embeddings using Word2Vec.

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone <repository-url>
cd Cross-domain-NER
